This project used masking to blend various images into one background. The raw images folder are the non-edited images that include photos I have taken of the figures and images form online (the cat and background image).
The edited image folder contains my masked images of the figures and cat image, and the final composite folder has those masked images all together into the background and I tried to blend them in by using various shading/positioning 
techniques. In the final composite folder, there is also the credits page for the sources I had used.
